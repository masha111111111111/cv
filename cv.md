### ***Briefly About Myself***
my goal is to get a good job in a good company,
I donâ€™t have my own work experience yet,
but there is not much in other areas.
At the moment I am studying at VSU and I want to learn and acquire new knowledge that will help me in the future in developing and remembering my business

I'm new to programming language, but I'm already learning c++, assembler and many others. version control systems and language framing are studied at the initial stages.
Now I am developing in various directions and I want to learn languages in which it will be possible to write many programs and games for children. and make money from it.


### ***Skills***
1. assembler
2. c++
3. access
4. excel
5. word
6. github
